# desktopniko
niko from the hit game oneshot, except they wander around ur desktop
## how do i use this
simply open the executable, right click on niko to open the control menu thingy (which allows u to do things like cloning niko, spawning pancakes, making niko stand still etc)
## why do all of them get removed when i only remove a one niko
do not remove the one which spawned in when u opened the executable, NET will fully terminate the program when the first form gets closed
## how do i compile and edit this
this can be compiled and edited with visual studio 2022, [heres a page about compiling things in visual studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-building-an-application?view=vs-2022)
### i do not associate with the oneshot dev team, all credits go to eliza, michael and nightmargin
